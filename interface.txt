config.ini interface
---------------------

I think the information between brackets will be called the
`setting`. There could be defined properties in wich setting. There will be
`default` setting with all properties. Another settings without
defined properties will be set by properties from default setting.

Properties list:
- nickname
- port
- service

Information about ini file: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file.


How file will looks like
------------------------

[default]

nickname = kra53n
port = ssh
service = github

[gitlab]

nickname = kra53n
service = gitlab

[c0ldst33l]

nickname = c0ldst33l


The next task is to think about cli interface.
